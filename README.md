# RAG-TranSum a RAG based text summarizer and translator for Audios from vid clips
## Working

The application processes audio and video files to extract transcribed text, saving it locally. Text data is not converted to vector embeddings or stored in a vector database. Users have the option to summarize or translate the extracted text, which is processed by the model to generate the output.

## Tasks

The project involved the following subtasks:

- **Task 1:** Extracting text from audio and video files.
- **Task 2:** Creating a vector DB for storing embeddings(chromaDB).
- **Task 3:** Developing a summarizer and translator using open-source Large Language Models (LLMs).
